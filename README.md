# Jax-Weather-Trends-DAND
- This was the first project in the Data Analyst Nanodegree from Udacity
- I queried a weather database through Udatcity's website and exported the results to csv
- What I queried:
  - I queried the Jax average weather temperature's moving average and global average weather temeperture's moving average and compared the two
- I was tasked with creating a visual; which was done in tableau and making observations about the visual
  
  #### This is a fun project to do a basic query using an aggregation in SQL and visualizing in tableau; unfortunetely, I don't have the database available as I queried the database through Udacity's website
